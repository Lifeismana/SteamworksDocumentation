<h1>Features</h1>
Steamworks offers a large collection of tools that can help you add value to your product. These
include things like Matchmaking, Achievements, and Steam Workshop (User-Generated Content). You are
free to use as few or as many as you like - not all features of Steamworks are appropriate for all
products.<br />
<br />
Some features like Trading Cards can be set up entirely in the Steamworks portal, while others will
need to be implemented in your product. See the

            Steam started as a multiplayer gaming platform with the release of Counter-Strike 1.6
            and multiplayer has always been a huge focus. Steam provides many different features and
            APIs to improve the multiplayer experience for developers and customers alike. With
            these features you can easily allow players to find and play with each other using the
            Steam Matchmaking APIs, or use the Steam Game Servers API to provide persistent
            dedicated servers that your players can create communities around.

            With the recent release of the new Steam Friends and Chat client we've enhanced the
            capabilities of our rich presence system to show more about the games being played. We
            see a player's rich presence as a way to engage the player's friends in their activity.
            For example, friends who own the game engage by knowing the right time to join the game
            or by talking about it with the player, and those who don't own the game may have their
            interest piqued by coming across a variety of rich presence strings that tell them more
            about a game that they don't know much about.
