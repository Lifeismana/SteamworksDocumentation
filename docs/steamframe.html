<h1>Steam Frame</h1>
Steam Frame is a standalone virtual reality headset designed primarily for low-latency streaming of
player's Steam Library from a PC, while also supporting standalone experiences for both VR and
Non-VR. The headset integrates high-resolution displays, inside-out tracking, integrated audio, and
full gamepad input into a self-contained system running SteamOS. By maintaining full compatibility
with SteamVR and OpenXR, Steam Frame provides a consistent development target across streamed PC VR
content and on-device applications. Supported execution models include Windows and Linux PC titles
as well as native ARM64 and Android-based APKs.
