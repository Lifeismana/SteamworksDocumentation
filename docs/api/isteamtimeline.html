Sets a description <strong><span style="color: #ffd55f">(B)</span></strong> for the current game
state in the timeline. These help the user to find specific<br />
moments in the timeline when saving clips. Setting a new state description replaces any previous<br />
description.<br />

Examples could include:<br />

    <li>The current score for a sports game</li>

            Provide the priority to use when the UI is deciding which icons to display in crowded
            parts of the timeline. Events with larger priority values will be displayed more
            prominently than events with smaller priority values. This value must be between 0 and

    <tr>
        <td><strong>flStartOffsetSeconds</strong></td>

            The time offset in seconds to apply to the start of the event. Negative times indicate
            an <br />
            event that happened in the past.<br />
            <br />
            One use of this parameter is to handle events whose significance is not clear until
            after the fact. For instance if the player starts a damage over time effect on another
            player, which kills them 3.5 seconds later, the game could pass -3.5 as the start offset
            and cause the event to appear in the timeline where the effect started.

            video clips.

</table>
<br />
Use this to mark an event <strong><span style="color: #ffd55f">(A)</span></strong> on the Timeline.
The event can be instantaneous or take some amount of time to complete, depending on the value
passed in flDurationSeconds.<br />
<br />
Examples could include:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>a boss battle<br /></li>
    <li>a cut scene<br /></li>
    <li>a large team fight<br /></li>
    <li>picking up a new weapon or ammo<br /></li>
    <li>scoring a goal</li>
</ul>
<br />
The game can nominate an event as being suitable for a clip by passing
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">k_ETimelineEventClipPriority_Standard</code> or
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">k_ETimelineEventClipPriority_Featured</code> to
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">ePossibleClip</code>. Players can make clips of
their own at any point, but this lets the game suggest some options to Steam to make that process
easier for players.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="enums"></a>Enums</h2>
These are enums which are defined for use with ISteamTimeline.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="ETimelineGameMode"></a>ETimelineGameMode</h2>
Controls the color of the timeline bar segments. The value names listed here map to a multiplayer
game, where<br />
the user starts a game (in menus), then joins a multiplayer session that first has a character
selection lobby<br />
then finally the multiplayer session starts. However, you can also map these values to any type of
game. In a single<br />
player game where you visit towns &amp; dungeons, you could set
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">k_ETimelineGameMode_Menus</code> when the player is
in a town<br />
buying items,
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">k_ETimelineGameMode_Staging</code> for when a
dungeon is loading and
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">k_ETimelineGameMode_Playing</code> for when<br />
inside the dungeon fighting monsters.<br />
