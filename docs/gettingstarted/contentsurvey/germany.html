<h1>German Age Ratings Required</h1>
German regulators have specified that all games must have a rating in order to be sold to customers
in Germany. Starting on November 15, 2024 Steam will no longer display games to customers in Germany
if the game is missing a valid age rating.<br />
<br />
To ensure that a game is available for sale in Germany, you need to truthfully complete Steam's
built-in content questionnaire and publish the results.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<strong>Q. When do I need to complete this questionnaire by?</strong><br />
A. You can complete the questionnaire at any time. Games without a German age rating will be hidden
from customers in Germany starting November 15, 2024.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >Q. If I fill out the questionnaire, is my game guaranteed to remain available in
    Germany?</strong
><br />
A. No. There are certain kinds of content that are not allowed for sale to customers in Germany. If
present in your game, this content must be disclosed in the content questionnaire. Please complete
the questionnaire completely and truthfully. Steam will automatically generate an appropriate rating
for your game in Germany. If the generated rating allows, your game will automatically become
visible to customers in Germany.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. What if my game has a USK rating?</strong><br />
A. If your game has been issued an age rating by going through the rating process directly with USK,
you may also enter that information within the store page editor for your game. This is rare. If you
do not have an agreement directly with USK, do not enter a USK rating.
