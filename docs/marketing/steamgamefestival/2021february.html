<strong>A Note on Future Events</strong><br />
<br />
Based on feedback from players and developers, we have decided to make the Steam Game Festival a
recurring event. The next event will be the June 2021 Edition. In order to make the selection of
games as relevant as possible for customers, games must meet the following criteria to be
eligible:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Games may only participate in one of the following events:
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>Autumn 2020 (Oct, 2020)<br /></li>
            <li>February 2021<br /></li>
            <li>June 2021</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Participating games must have a planned release date within 6 months following the festival.
        If you think your release date will be more than 6 months after the festival, you should
        plan to opt-in to a future event. Note that releasing into Early Access will still count as
        a release, since the game will be purchasable and playable by the Steam community.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="events"></a>Events</h2>
During the festival, we encourage you to schedule streaming or other events to interact with the
Steam community and show off your demo. During the Steam Game Festival, you'll be able to schedule
up to two live stream events which will appear on a calendar for players to browse. <br />
<br />
You can see a current schedule for other games' scheduled livestreams, so you can plan your own
accordingly:

<br />
<strong>Q: Are Early Access games eligible to participate in the Steam Game Festival?</strong><br />

Game Festival. To participate in the Festival, you will need to have the demo build of your game
reviewed and approved. Please remember to give at least 3-5 business days to allow enough time for
your build to be tested.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. I've changed my plans. How do I opt out?</strong><br />
