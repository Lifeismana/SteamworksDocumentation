<h1>Sale Page Section: Apps And Bundles</h1>
The cornerstone of sale pages is the ability to display games and bundles. This section is critical
for defining the list of products and how they should appear on your page.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Options for defining the list of games</h2>
You need to define the set of games or bundles to show in this section, and there are three
different ways you can approach that.<br />
<br />
Here are the options:
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>1. Directly adding games</h2>
The most simple way to display games within a app section is to add them individually to the section
itself. To do this, find the "Add Individual Apps" area. You'll either type in the game name or
appID and select the game from the drop-down.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>2. Using filters with a linked app list</h2>
If you have more than about 50 games, and if you want to organize them by genre or tag, you may want
to use the linked app list. With this method, you define the set of games at the top of the sale
page editor tools and then use filters for app sections to display different sets of titles for each
section.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>3. Smart sections with a linked app list</h2>
This is a set of options that will populate an app section using some pre-defined criteria. This is
most often used to personalize the display of games for each user visiting your page, for example by
showing the player games that are part of this event that are on their withlist or are recommended
to them by Steam.<br />
<br />
<strong>To configure</strong>: You first need to add all your games to the linked app list at the
top of the editor. Then, add a new section and toggle on the 'smart section' option. You'll see a
new drop-down appear, with a set of options:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Games from wishlist<br /></li>
    <li>Interactive Recommender<br /></li>
    <li>Games that match recommended tag<br /></li>
    <li>Games on discount</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Options for display of games</h2>
These options can be combined in a variety of ways to achieve the look you are going for.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Display as a carousel</h2>
If you set a section to appear as a carousel, any items that do not fit in the initial display will
accessible by click the right or left arrows that appear next to the section.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Display as a grid</h2>
You can choose how many rows and how many items per row you display for each section. There are a
few different options to make the layout interesting.<br />
2/3/4/3<br />

<br />
If you set the rows and items-per-row each to "1" you can also choose different layout formats with
more information displayed about each game. For example, you can choose a format that runs the
microtrailer in the background and shows tags and reviews.
