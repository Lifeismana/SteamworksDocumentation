<h1>Sale Page Section: Apps And Bundles</h1>
The cornerstone of sale pages is the ability to display games. This section is critical for
displaying and organizing the games on your page.<br />
<br />
<br />
These are apps, packages, or bundles. They can be organized into grids or carousels or can display a
single item.<br />

<br />
If you set the rows and items-per-row each to "1" you can also choose different layout formats with
more information displayed about each game. For example, you can choose a format that runs the
microtrailer in the background and shows tags and reviews.

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Directly adding games</h2>
The most simple way to display games within a app section is to add them individually to the section
itself. To do this, find the "Add Individual Apps" area. You'll either type in the game name or
appID and select the game from the drop-down.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Using filters with a linked app list</h2>
If you have more than about 50 games, and if you want to organize them by genre or tag, you may want
to use the linked app list. With this method, you define the set of games at the top of the sale
page editor tools and then use filters for app sections to display different sets of titles for each
section.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Smart sections with a linked app list</h2>
This is a set of options that will populate an app section using some pre-defined criteria. This is
most often used to personalize the display of games for each user visiting your page, for example by
showing the player games that are part of this event that are on their withlist or are recommended
to them by Steam.<br />
<br />
<strong>To configure</strong>: You first need to add all your games to the linked app list at the
top of the editor. Then, add a new section and toggle on the 'smart section' option. You'll see a
new drop-down appear, with a set of options:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Games from wishlist<br /></li>
    <li>Playtime Recommender<br /></li>
    <li>Games that match recommended tag<br /></li>
    <li>Games on discount</li>
</ul>
