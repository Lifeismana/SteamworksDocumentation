        <strong>October 12</strong> - The trailer announcing the event launches on this day. At this
        point, you're welcome to share your participation in the event. Assets for this purpose will
        be available in the <a href="#asset">Asset Kit</a> below.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>October 12 @ 10:00am PST</strong> - The event starts. This is the deadline for
        entering a discount, and opting out if you no longer want to participate.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="eligibility"></a>Eligibility</h2>
As you might expect, eligible games will be primarily about cooking or will be culinarily inclined.
It is fine to have additional gameplay elements like harvesting ingredients, fighting off bandits,
or designing your storefront, but cooking (or serving food) must be an important part of the
gameplay.<br />
<br />
Realism is not required; though games that carefully mimic real-life cooking are welcome, games that
have a more abstract take to cooking are eligible as well.<br />
<br />
Hotel/motel simulators, though they occasionally have culinarily minded elements, are not eligible.
Restaurant, pub, food truck, cafe, and food factory simulators are eligible as the primary purpose
of the building is to serve food. However, games that are mostly about only food <i>delivery</i> may
not be eligible. This is Cooking Fest, so cooking is an important element!<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, farming simulators and visual novels are not going to be eligible.<br />
<br />
Games that include food elements but are not about cooking itself are not eligible. Some examples:
counting grains of rice, fighting off bears from stealing your food, and any game where you play
food but the goal is not to be cooked. For the sake of this Fest, potions are not cooking.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="asset"></a>Asset Kit</h2>
We’ve created an asset kit of images and templates for you to use on your own social media channels
when telling your fans about your participation in this event. These assets are designed to work
well on various platforms and you're welcome to use them to let players know you'll be
participating. Our official event trailer will typically launch around 4 days prior to the event; we
recommend the same timing for utilizing these assets to promote your participation on your own
channels. (please reference <a href="#dates">Important Dates</a> above).<br />

<strong>Q. Will there be livestreaming as part of this event?</strong><br />

game's store page as you wish.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. I've changed my plans. How do I cancel my registration?</strong><br />
A. Just return to the registration page for your game by inserting your appID at the end of this URL

    target="_blank"

<br />
<strong
    >Q. Can I promote our participation in the event on our own channels before the trailer goes
    live?</strong
><br />
A. Technically yes; you can publish once the Asset Kit is available for download, but we recommend
waiting until the event trailer is live (again, roughly 4 days prior to the event) as a more
effective communications beat with your audience.<br />
