The <strong>Steam Autumn Sale</strong> is all about shopping for great games and nominating your
favorites in the 2024 Steam Awards. This year's event runs November 27th - December 4th at 10am
Pacific.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Steam Awards Nominations</h2>
To solicit your fans' nomination in the Steam Awards, choose the award category for which you'd like
to be considered. Use the relevant piece of artwork available via Dropbox here along with your
title's box art when communicating with players and fans on Steam and social media. We recommend
creating a new "Steam Awards Nomination Suggestion" announcement, which is now available to you from
the event dashboard.<br />
