<h1>Discounting</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Discounting can be a valuable tool to help grow your audience and extend the life of your product on
Steam. You can participate in official sales events and take advantage of discounting tools to run
your own custom discounts.<br />
<br />
In general, we've found that there is a customer at every price point, and an effective discounting
strategy can contribute to overall long term success on Steam.<br />
<br />
As always, this advice is generalized for a huge variety of products, developers, and customers, so
take your own product and community into account when making decisions.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Configuring Discounts</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Required Permissions</h2>
Discounting requires the "Manage Pricing &amp; Discounts" permission for the relevant product. In
addition, you must be a member of the Steamworks partner that is getting paid for the product you
are trying to discount.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>How to Configure</h2>
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        Navigate to the new discounting dashboard here:
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/promotion/discounts/dashboard/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >https://partner.steamgames.com/promotion/discounts/dashboard/</a
        >
        (or select "Apps &amp; Packages -&gt; Discount Management")<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        On this page you will see a grid of the games you have pricing permission for and all
        upcoming sales that your games can participate in.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Simply enter a valid discount for each package and event as desired and click the 'save'
        button at the bottom of the page.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>How to Edit a Discount</h2>
Discounts can be edited up until the discount itself has started. You can do so by visiting the same
dashboard URL as you used to create the discount and simply change the discount % you wish to set.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>How to Delete a Discount</h2>
Discount can be deleted up until the discount itself has started. You can delete a discount by
visiting your discounting dashboard and entering the number 0 for the discount percentage. Click
'save' the same way you would when entering a discount and you will have removed that discount.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Specific Discounting Rules</h2>
<br />
Steam's discount rules are as follows:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Discounts cannot be run within 30 days of your prior discount, with the exception of
        Steam-wide seasonal events (Summer, Autumn, Winter and Springs sales). <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You can run a launch discount, but once your launch discount ends, you cannot run any other
        discounts for 30 days.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        It is not possible to discount your product for 30 days following a price increase in
        <i>any </i>currency.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Discounts for seasonal sale events cannot be run within 30 days of releasing your title,
        within 30 days from when your launch discount ends, or within 30 days of a price increase in
        any currency.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You may not change your price while a promotion is currently live or scheduled for the
        future.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        It is not possible to discount a product by more than 90% or less than 10%. Launch discounts
        in particular cannot exceed 40%. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        it is not possible to create new discounts for a product that would result in the price in
        any currency falling below Steam's minimum possible transaction price.

        Custom discounts cannot last longer than two weeks, or run for shorter than 1 day. Launch
        discounts cannot run shorter than 7 days or longer than 14 days.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="8"></a>Types of Discounts</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Self-Serve</h2>
Partners are able to create and manage the following discounts on their own. Any discount set to 20%
or greater will automatically trigger email notifications to players with your game on their
wishlist. Discounted titles are eligible to appear in various 'specials' sections throughout Steam,
based on your game's tags, popularity of your game, and to users that it is recommended.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="10"></a>Launch Discount</h2>
    Launch discounts start once your title is released on Steam and can be staged to run for between
    7 and 14 days, ending at 10am Pacific on the applicable day. We generally suggest launch
    discounts around 10% to 15%, should you chose to set one. There is a limit of 40%. Launch
    Discounts are optional and are configured near your release date setting on your app landing
    page.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="11"></a>Weeklong Deals</h2>
    Weeklong Deals begin every Monday morning at 10AM Pacific time and run for 7 days.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="12"></a>Custom Discounts</h2>
    You can configure your own custom discounts to align with special events like a major update or
    the anniversary of your products's release. You can schedule a custom discount to begin on the
    following calendar day.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="13"></a>Themed Sales</h2>
    Steam organizes various themed sales events designed to showcase certain categories of games.
    These events will have specific criteria for eligibility, and a process of invitation,
    registration, and discounting. Each of these sales will be promoted on the homepage of Steam and
    organized into sub-categories relevant for each event.
    <a

        class="bb_doclink"
        >Learn more here.</a
    >
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="14"></a>Seasonal Sales</h2>
    There are four major seasonal sale events per year, which take over the Steam store experience
    in a big way. All games on Steam are invited to participate with a discount. These four events
    are Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.
    <a
        href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/discounts/seasonalsales"
        class="bb_doclink"
        >Learn more here.</a
    >
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="15"></a>Curated</h2>
The following discount types are created and managed by Valve. When selecting products to fill these
front-page promotional slots, we consider games of all price points and genres. While there aren't
exact rules, as a base guideline we tend to focus on the most-played or best-selling games on Steam.
If your title qualifies for an upcoming curated slot, we will contact you with details. These
promotional slots aren't negotiated for or sold, they're just built around player data. If your game
has lots of happy customers and you'd like to discuss promotion options, feel free to
<a
    href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithPublishing"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >contact us any time. </a
><br />
<br />
There are three main types of curated promo slots for products. The default discount length for all
three promo slots is one week, but we're happy to be flexible with shorter or longer discounts,
within our existing discount policies.<br />
<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="16"></a>Daily Deal</h2>
    Daily Deals are featured on the Steam homepage for 24 hours, and rotate every day at 10am
    Pacific. There are two or more Daily Deal slots per day. The artwork used for the Daily Deal is
    our standard "Header Capsule" 460px x 215px, and is imported from the associated game or bundle
    automatically. Daily Deal discounts run from 7 to 14 days.
    <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/discounts/dailydeal" class="bb_doclink"
        >Learn more here.</a
    >
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="17"></a>Midweek Deal</h2>
    Midweek Deal promotions are featured on the Steam homepage for 72 hours, from Monday at 10am
    Pacific until Thursday at 10am Pacific. There are up to six Midweek slots per week. The artwork
    used for the Midweek promotion requires custom asset sizes detailed
    <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/assets/promos" class="bb_doclink">here</a
    >, which will be localized by Valve. Midweek discounts default to one week, but by publisher
    request we can run those discounts anywhere from 3 to 14 days.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="18"></a>Weekend Deal</h2>
    Weekend Deal promotions are featured on the Steam homepage for 96 hours, from Thursday at 10am
    Pacific until Monday at 10am Pacific. There are up to six Weekend Deal slots per week. Similar
    to Midweek promotions, Weekend Deals require custom asset sizes detailed
    <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/assets/promos" class="bb_doclink">here</a
    >, which will be localized by Valve. Weekend Deal discounts default to one week, but by
    publisher request we can run those discounts anywhere from 4 to 14 days.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="19"></a>Visual Example of Curated Deals</h2>
    Here's a sample display of the Special Offers carousel on the Steam homepage. Midweek and
    Weekend spotlights occupy the larger spaces on the left side. Daily Deals are on the right side.
    A user can page through this carousel, where they'll see multiple spotlights from curated sales,
    as well as other discounted products that are organically recommended based on current
    popularity with customers.

    />
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="21"></a>Free Weekends</h2>
    Free Weekends are promotions where customers have temporary access to your game. Users can try
    out the game for free, but lose access when the time period expires. This kind of offer is used
    strategically for certain types of games or circumstances, and is usually paired with a discount
    to help convert trial players to paying customers.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="bestpractices"></a>Discounting Best Practices</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="22"></a>Stairstep your discounts</h2>
    It's typically best to ease into discounting, and increase the level of discount over time. For
    example, a title might move from 33% to 50% to 66% to 75% and beyond over the course of a year
    or more. Rushing into a 50% or 75% discount weeks after your launch, or releasing with a very
    high launch discount, sends a bad message to customers who bought at full price and undermines
    the value of your title.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="23"></a>Time discounts to content updates</h2>
    When figuring out your discounting plan, try to make as big an event as possible, ideally tying
    the discount to a content update as well. While the discount can attract interest, it's even
    better to show you are committed to your community by improving your product with content
    updates.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="24"></a>Take your sales decay curve into account</h2>
    It can be tempting to use small discounts in an attempt to climb the Top Sellers list or gain
    more exposure in the early days of your title, but look carefully at how many customers are
    purchasing your product at full price before entering a discount. It's important for customers
    to feel good about their investment, so it's probably best to use discounts once you've settled
    into the tail of your sales curve.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection">
        <a name="25"></a>Discount all associated packages (DLC, Deluxe Editions) at the same time
    </h2>
    If your product has multiple editions or DLC, discount them all together. Discounting only part
    of your product, or putting the base game on sale this week and the Deluxe Edition next week,
    dilutes your exposure and prevents you from taking advantage of all the network effects of Steam
    that happen as more users get excited about your product at the same time. You might not want to
    match the discount on every package. For example, if one DLC is a year old, and the another just
    came out, it probably makes sense to choose a different discount percentage for each.

<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Q: How are Steam curated promotions scheduled? Can we bring ideas to Steam?</strong
        ><br />
        A: Scheduling promotions has typically been a conversation between you and Steam. We may
        come to you with ideas, and if you feel you have an idea of a unique Curated Promotion,
        please contact us. But you can also set up your own discounts whenever works best for you,
        or you can opt into the regular weekly sales.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Q: Are promotions mandatory on Steam?</strong><br />
        A: No. We might invite you to take part in a special event or promotion, but there is
        nothing that you are required to participate in.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Q: How are discounts approved?</strong><br />
        A: For Curated Promotions, Valve will come to you with an idea for your approval if we think
        your title is a good fit for one of these promotions.<br />
        <br />
        For Self-Serve Promotions, once you set up your discount using our Discount tool, then your
        game will automatically go on sale at the date and time you specified.<br />
        <br />
        For detailed information about best practices with discounts, see
        <a href="#bestpractices" class="bb_doclink">Discounting Best Practices</a>.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Q: Can I update a discount?</strong><br />
        A: Yes, if your discount is not yet live, then you can edit or delete it.<br />
        <br />
        If you would like to adjust your Launch Discount, you can do so by going to your game's
        landing page and clicking the box next to the launch discount you have entered currently.<br />
        <br />
        If you would like to change a discount for an upcoming weeklong sale, custom discount or
        Steam-wide seasonal sale, then you can simply return to
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/promotion/discounts/dashboard/"

            rel="noreferrer"
            >your discounting dashboard</a

        and change the percentage you wish for any given discount. To remove a discount, just set
        the discount percentage to 0%.<br />

        <strong
            >Q: Can I participate in Steam-wide seasonal sale events if my product recently
            launched?</strong
        ><br />
        A: Generally, you cannot submit a discount within 30 days of release or until 30 days from
        when the launch discount ends, however, there are a couple options if your game "just
        released".<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                If your game launched 30 days prior to the start of the seasonal sale and DID NOT
                have a launch discount, then you are welcome to join the seasonal sale and enter a
                discount.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                If your game launched 30 days prior and had a launch discount, then when that
                discount cooldown DOES prevent you from joining the seasonal sale. You could choose
                to join the sale already in progress after the discount cooldown for establishing
                your base price ends. There are always future opportunities to put your game on
                discount, so you shouldn't feel pressured to change your release date for the sake
                of a seasonal sale event.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                You can now choose your launch discount duration to be between 7 and 14 days, so if
                you launch close to a seasonal sale and would like to have a launch discount extend
                into that sale, then you could choose a max launch discount duration of 14 days. We
                cannot extend a launch discount longer than 14 days, so you might miss the final
                days of a seasonal sale.
            </li>

            >Q: Can I run a launch discount when transitioning from Early Access to fully
            released?</strong
        ><br />
        A. You may run a launch discount and participate in the Steam-wide seasonal sales events
        when transitioning from Early Access to fully released, unless you have increased your
        product's price within the last 30 days.<br />
        <br />

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Q: How often can I discount my game?</strong><br />
        A: Custom discounts must be spaced at least 30 days apart and at least 30 days after the
        release of your product on Steam. Custom discounts don't affect eligibility for Steam
        Seasonal Sales. Note that the 30-day cooldown for new releases and price increases still
        applies for the Steam Seasonal Sales.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Q. Will these new discount cooldowns apply to curated promotions too?</strong><br />
        A. Yes, discount cooldowns will apply to promotions like Daily Deals, Midweek Deals, Weekend
        Deals, Weeklong deals, publisher weekends, and any custom discounts. Any discount applied to
        a game must have 30 days between the end of one discount and the beginning of the next
        discount. The only exceptions to this cooldown are the four seasonal seasonal sales: Spring,
        Summer, Autumn, Winter.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Q: Is there a limit to how deeply I can discount a game?</strong><br />
        A: You can set a game discount up to 95% off the base price. However, the Steam store only
        supports a minimum unit sale of $0.49 USD or equivalent in each currency or region (see
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/pricing/minimums" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Price Minimums</a
        >
        for a table of minimums per currency). As such, a discount on a package can only bring the
        discounted price down to $0.49 USD. Also, if you set prices below the suggested equivalent
        price in any currency or region, your discounts may be restricted by the minimum discounted
        price in that currency or region. If you wish to sell content below these limits, you are
        welcome to use the
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/inventory" class="bb_doclink"
            >Steam Inventory service</a
        >
        to sell items within your game.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Q: I thought the cooldown was 28 days, not 30 days?</strong><br />
        A: As of January 1, 2023, the cooldown requirement has been extended from 28 days to 30
        days.
    </li>
</ul>
