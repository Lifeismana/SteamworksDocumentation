        <h5>In Brief</h5>
        Steam can host and distribute a demo version of your game that you can use to demonstrate
        part of your gaming experience.
        <h5>Level of integration</h5>
        Demos can range in size and scope, but generally are a small playable portion of your game
        that show some of the core mechanics and leave the player excited for more.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Steam has the ability to provide free demos for your customers so that they can try before they
buy.<br />
<br />
It's up to you whether or not a demo will be beneficial for your title, but there are a couple of
useful things to consider:<br />
<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        Quality – Customers are generally using the demo to make a purchase decision on your game.
        Make sure that what you put out there is high quality and measures up to the real
        experience.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Timing – When you release your demo is also important. We generally recommend waiting until
        launch, but there are circumstances where putting a demo out prior to release is effective.
        If, for instance, you feel like customers need to touch the game to really understand it,
        then a quality demo prior to release can be useful.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Length – You need to balance giving the customer enough content to get them excited, without
        giving away so much that they feel like they've experienced everything the game has to
        offer.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Technical configuration</h2>
Demos are a separate App ID that is associated with your full game's App ID. The demo will need to
be configured with depots, and builds must be created just like a full app.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>To create your demo App ID:</h2>
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        From your base game's App Landing Page, click on "All associated packages, DLC, demos and
        tools."<br />
    </li>
    <li>At the top of this page, click the "Add Demo" button.<br /></li>
    <li>
        The demo you created has its own release checklist and configuration, similar to your base
        product.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>To upload your demo build</h2>
Please see
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/uploading" class="bb_doclink">Uploading to Steam</a>
to get started with how to upload your demo build (make sure you use the App ID for your demo).
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Minimizing upgrade impact</h2>
There are a few things you can do to minimize the friction to upgrade from the demo to the full
game. Note that for these to work, the full game must already be released.<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        Share depots with the full app: For any content that's shared between the full app and the
        demo, put it into its own depot and mount the shared depot from the base app into the demo
        app. See the
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/depots#shared_content_depots"
            class="bb_doclink"
            >Shared Content Depots</a
        >
        documentation for more info.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Share cloud storage with the full app: The saved game from the demo can be stored to the
        full game's cloud storage so that users can pick up where they left off in the demo once
        they buy the full game. See the
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/cloud" class="bb_doclink"
            >Steam Cloud</a
        >
        documentation for more info.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Demo store page &amp; presence</h2>
<img

/><br />
<br />
As you are configuring your demo within Steamworks, you will need to set up a store presence with
some graphical assets and written descriptions. During the creation of your store presence, you will
be able to choose to configure an entire store page for your demo, or just provide some assets for
your demo to appear on your base game's store page. Read on for more details on these two options.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Optional separate store page</h2>
When setting up your demo store presence, you can optionally choose to enable an entire separate
store page for your demo, giving you space to more fully describe your demo. <br />
<br />
A demo store page includes most of the same features as a normal game on Steam, including the
following:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>You can provide a detailed written description<br /></li>
    <li>You can list the features, languages, and player modes supported by your demo<br /></li>
    <li>Your demo will let players of the demo leave user reviews<br /></li>
    <li>
        Regardless of whether you create a separate store page or not, demos do not have their own
        community hub<br />
    </li>
    <li>Your demo will still also show as a button on your base game's store page<br /></li>
    <li>
        Steam will automatically include a prominent link from your demo store page back to your
        full game, making it easy for players to wishlist or purchase your game.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Store presence release checklist</h2>
You will notice that there is a release checklist for "Store Presence", which will be longer if you
choose to create a separate store page for your demo. Otherwise this is a much shorter store
checklist than for your full game, and generally only requires a few assets and bits of information
that may differ between your demo and full game.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="9"></a>Testing your demo</h2>
To work properly for customers, your application type must be set as 'Demo' and the App ID of your
base game must be entered in the General Application Settings section of the Steamworks website for
your demo. <br />
<br />
Your primary developer account will automatically own both the demo and the base game, and you can
test by simply launching your demo from the Steam Library.<br />
<br />
If you wish to test your demo on a new account that is not a member of your Steamworks developer
account, you'll need to request
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/keys" class="bb_doclink">keys</a> for your demo
and activate them on the account you wish to test with.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="10"></a>Marketing the Full App</h2>
You can direct customers to the full app from your demo by utilizing the Steam Overlay. The in-app
overlay allows you to put a link to the store page right in your app. See the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/overlay" class="bb_doclink">Steam Overlay</a>
documentation and
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamFriends#ActivateGameOverlayToStore"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamFriends::ActivateGameOverlayToStore</a
>
for more details.<br />
<br />
Players of your demo will also see a prominent link from the demo in their library to the full
game's store page.<br />
<br />

    alt="DemoUpsell.jpg"
    title="DemoUpsell.jpg"
/>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="11"></a>Using Achievements in Demos</h2>
We recommend that you disable achievements in demos. Instead, store the saved game in the shared
Steam Cloud as described in the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/cloud" class="bb_doclink"
    >Cloud documentation</a
>. Then grant those achievements on loading the game in the full game after the user has purchased.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="12"></a>Releasing Your Demo</h2>
To prepare for release, please make sure to complete the checklists found on the right-hand side of
the landing page for your demo. Once completed, you can mark your demo page and build as ready for
review.<br />
<br />
If you are releasing your demo prior to your base product being available, you will need to prepare
your base game's store page and make sure it is visible as 'coming soon' so users can add the full
game to their wishlist (also see:
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/wishlist" class="bb_doclink"
    >Steam Wishlists</a
>). <br />
<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <h2 class="bb_subsection">
            <a name="13"></a>Releasing for 'upcoming' visibility (Optional)
        </h2>
        You can release your demo's store page presence ahead of the release of your demo in order
        to appear on the list of upcoming demos. This process is similar to putting up a 'coming
        soon' page for your base game; once you complete store page review, you will see a 'post
        coming soon' button appear at the top of your demo's app landing page in Steamworks.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="14"></a>Releasing directly to playable</h2>
        If you want to skip the 'upcoming' phase of your demo and simply release, then you can use
        the main 'Release Demo..." button that appears once your demo has been fully reviewed.
        Releasing your demo will automatically also publish your store page assets as well.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
Once released, the demo can show up as new in the demo section. Clicking on the demo capsule in the
store will take users to either the main game's store page where there's a demo button, or to your
separate demo store page if you have configured one.<br />
<br />
Please see the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/releasing" class="bb_doclink">Release Process</a>
documentation for general information about preparing an app for release.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="15"></a>Triggering release notifications</h2>
Once you make your demo playable for the first time, you can trigger sending notifications (emails
and mobile app notifications) to players who have the associated full game on their wishlist. This
action is available on your demo app landing page for two weeks following the initial launch of your
demo. You can only take this action once and you must do it within those first two weeks.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="disabling"></a>Disabling Your Demo</h2>
If you wish for your demo to only be available for a limited time, such as during a game conference
or festival, you can deactivate and reactivate it once it has been released. Deactivating a demo
will prevent players from downloading or launching your demo. Players that already have your demo in
their library will continue to see the demo (so they may uninstall it) but cannot launch it
again.<br />
<br />
To Deactivate or re-activate a demo, find the option under 'Technical Tools' on your demo's app
landing page and click "Deactivate Demo"<br />
<br />

        Note: Once your demo is disabled, customers may still be able to launch it outside of Steam
        unless your demo requires Steam to launch and checks to see if the user has a current
        license to it. You can learn more here:

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="16"></a>Demo visibility in the Steam store</h2>
Demos can appear anywhere in Steam that a free game could appear. This includes lists such as the
"New &amp; Trending" as well as lists within store hubs, tag pages, genre pages, and so forth.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="17"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<strong>Q: Can I make a demo accessible on the full game's 'coming soon' page?</strong><br />
A: Yes, your demo can be made available to players on a Coming Soon page before the full game
releases.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: Can my demo users play Steam multiplayer with my full game users?</strong><br />
A: Steam currently doesn't support multiplayer matchmaking between the full game and the demo.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: What if my demo consists of literally the same files as the full game?</strong><br />
A: If your full game is already released, then you can use a shared depot as described in the
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/depots#shared_content_depots"
    class="bb_doclink"
    >Shared Content Depots</a
>
documentation. Do the following to make sure the demo and full app both work correctly.<br />
<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        If you use
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/drm" class="bb_doclink">Steam DRM</a>,
        re-submit the exe for signing on the demo Steamworks app admin. Package the demo exe into a
        depot specific to the demo app. Alternatively, you can skip Steam DRM and just call
        <a

        >.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If there is behavior that is restricted to owners of the full app, gate it behind the
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamApps#BIsSubscribedApp"

        >
        Steamworks API call with the App ID of the full app.
    </li>
</ol>
<br />
<strong>Q: How to get the Demo to show up on the base application's store page?</strong><br />
A: On the store page admin, go to the "Special Settings" tab and add the Demo's app ID in the
"Associated Demos" section. Save &amp; Publish. The demo will need to be released for it to show
upon the base application's store page.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: How do I remove a Demo from the base application's store page?</strong><br />
A: On the store page admin for the base game, go to the "Special Settings" tab and remove the Demo's
app ID in the "Associated Demos" section. Save &amp; Publish. Note that this does not disable the
demo, it just removes the visible button from your full game's store page.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: How do I remove a Demo entirely from the Steam store?</strong><br />
A: Please see <a href="#disabling" class="bb_doclink">Disabling Your Demo</a> above<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: Can I disable the store page for my demo?</strong><br />
A: Yes, if you no longer wish to have a stand-alone store page for your demo, then you can disable
the store page on the 'basic info' tab within the 'edit store' section of Steamworks for your demo.
The demo will then only be accessible via the full game's store page. Any links that lead to the
previous demo's store page, will automatically redirect to the full game's store page.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >Q: If I disable my demo and re-enable it later, can I still send wishlist
    notifications?</strong
><br />
A: Wishlist notifications may only be triggered once, within 14 days of the demo releasing to
players for the first time. This is the date that appears at the top of the right-hand column on
your demo's app landing page.
