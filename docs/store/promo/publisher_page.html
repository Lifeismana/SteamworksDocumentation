<h1>Publisher or Developer Sales</h1>
Occasionally game developers or publishers ask about hosting a 'publisher sale' on Steam, gathering
up and discounting all of the games made or published by a certain company. We’re happy to share the
tools for setting up and hosting your own publisher sale, though for the most part we’re not able to
give the publisher sale front-page visibility. <br />
<br />
However, Steam is already set up to use the power of your own catalog of games to promote your
event. After setting up a sale page that includes all of the games made by a developer or publisher,
there is an optional ‘store banner’ that can be configured. That clickable banner would then appear
on top of each of your game’s store pages, leading players back to your main sale page.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Rules</h2>
When you are thinking about putting together a publisher sale, here are the main points for you to
know and agree to:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        The hosting of your event, use of sale page editor tools, and any promotion on Steam is all
        at the discretion of Valve.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Your landing page should clearly explain both the event and the group that is organizing it.
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                In addition, any promotional banners used on Steam (including Store Page Banners)
                must also clearly describe the name of the event and who is hosting/organizing the
                event.
            </li>
            <li>
                Please avoid naming your event a "____ Fest" unless your event has been called this
                prior to promotion on Steam.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Unless specifically agreed upon with Valve, we cannot promise any specific Steam store
        visibility for the event. Marketing efforts would be 100% up to you and the individual game
        developers involved. In some cases, we choose to help promote events, but we usually can't
        make that call until we know which games you'll have participating, the scope of the event,
        and any accompanying promotion or activities.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If Valve chooses to promote your page within the Steam store:<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                Broadcasting - We need to approve what broadcasting content will be shown. This is
                generally fine for industry talks or game announcement, but since we don't sell ad
                space on Steam, we want to be aware (as well as approve) of any kind of sponsorship
                logos or possibly ads for other brands or stores prior to the launch of the
                event.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                All graphical banners and images need to be provided to Valve as layered .psd files
                at least a week ahead of time for localization.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Product page banner - this banner shows up on store pages of the apps that are included in
        the event and provides a bit of cross promotion value.<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                The only acceptable logos that can appear on Store Page Banners are for the name of
                the developer or publisher being promoted.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        If the sale and page is about promoting your developer or publisher's collection of games,
        then it should <strong>only </strong>include games from that developer or publisher.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Additionally, every game on Steam is eligible to appear in only one developer or publisher
        sale a year. If it could fit into more than that, please choose the one that makes the most
        sense for the title.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Access to the sale-building tools</h2>
Once we've agreed that your proposed event makes sense to run on Steam, we can grant you access to
the sale page editor tools. These tools allow you to define the list of participating games, create
sub-categories for organizing them (if appropriate) and uploading your custom artwork for the
background of the page and associated marketing banners.<br />

            >Create a Steam Community group</a
        >
        with the name of your publisher or developer. You already have one if you set up a

            >Developer Homepage</a
        >
        on Steam already.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Let your Valve contact know the URL of your group. Valve will enable the sale tools for an
        event under your group.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Event Visibility</h2>
Publisher sales are only promoted on the homepage of Steam under certain circumstances, where the
catalog of games has multiple top-performing titles. However, there are a couple of ways that Steam
can help your event be easily discovered by players.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Special Offers Page</h2>
All sale events will automatically appear listed in the "Special Events" section of the
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/specials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Special Offers page</a
>
for players looking for good deals on games.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Store Page Banners</h2>
Steam is already set up to use the power of your own catalog of games to promote your event. After
setting up a sale page that includes all of the games made by a developer or publisher, there is an
optional ‘store banner’ that can be configured. That clickable banner would then appear on top of
each of your game’s store pages, leading players back to your main sale page.<br />
<br />
When all of your game's discounts go live, the players that wishlist any one of those games will get
the usual Steam wishlist notification and can easily find their way from that individual game via
the store page banner to your full publisher sale page.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Curated Deal On A Featured Game</h2>
Instead of featuring a publisher sale on the homepage of Steam, we are more likely to feature an
individual game or franchise if you have a game that qualifies for one of our curated discount
spots. In this case, we would use a Daily Deal, Midweek Deals, or Weekend Deal spot to feature your
best-selling game to drive player interest. Then the power of your store page banners (as described
above) would help those players find their way to the rest of your catalog.<br />
<br />
