<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Talk Highlights</h2>
Here are a few highlights from the talk, along with video timestamps where you can find that portion
of the talk begin:
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>0:00 - Tom Giardino</h2>
Tom starts by talking about Valve's goals and priorities for Steam for 2019 and beyond.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>7:10 - Alden Kroll</h2>
Alden describes new features coming to Steam to help developers build closer relationships with
players. Among these features are:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Steam Events - A brand new way for developers to have a real-time, open line of
        communication with their players inside of the Steam client.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Steam Library Update - We've totally redesigned the Steam Library from the ground up. You
        can easily see what's going on inside of any individual game, from recent updates to
        on-going events, organize your game collection the way you want, and much more.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Per-app traffic and visibility dashboard - We've improved the tools that allow developers to
        see how players are reaching their store pages and where and how often their games is
        showing up across all of Steam.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Developer and Publisher Homepages - Fans can follow developers or publishers and
        automatically get a notification when that developer or publisher releases another game.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Store page streaming - Developers can choose to feature a stream of their game right there
        on the store page; showing potential customers exactly what it's like to play their game.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Updates to user reviews - We've updated tools and functionality to mitigate the effects of
        off-topic review bombing.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>23:22 - Kassidy Gerber</h2>
Kassidy talks about the new best-in-class network that Valve makes available for game developers to
use in multiplayer games. This new free API provides game developers with:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        A durable, reliable, world-wide private network upon which to host, deliver and match-make
        their games.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Fast ping times between clients and servers<br /></li>
    <li>Protection from DDoS attacks</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>32:44 - Ricky Uy</h2>
Ricky talks about Valve's focus on growing PC games in emerging markets to create even more
opportunity on Steam for our developer and publisher partners.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        How we make games accessible to players no matter where they live and in all the ways in
        which they're familiar playing.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        How we support all of the payment methods and currencies that allow customers to buy games
        in the easiest ways possible.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        How cash payment methods, while potentially cumbersome for the platform, are essential in
        dozens of countries and the ways Steam facilitates the ease of those transactions.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The payment methods throughout Asia and and other parts of the world: for instance, almost
        90% of transactions in East Asia don't use major credit cards or PayPal.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        PC Cafes are an important way that many customers play games. Steam makes it easy to enable
        play in those cafes.
    </li>
</ul>
